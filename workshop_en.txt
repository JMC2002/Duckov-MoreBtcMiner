[h1]More BTC Miner[/h1]

[h2]Features[/h2]

You can now build more Bitcoin miners. By default, two additional miners are added.  
If you install [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3595729494]ModSetting[/url], you can adjust the miner limit in the settings.  
Setting the limit to [b]0[/b] means [b]no limit[/b].

[h2]Safety Notes[/h2]
[list]
[*] Before enabling this mod, please remove all cards from your original miners manually.  
   If you forget to remove them, you can disable this mod and retrieve the cards from the original miners.
[*] Before uninstalling this mod, please take all cards out of every miner.  
   If you forget, you can resubscribe to this mod and retrieve them from the original miners.
[*] Before dismantling a miner, make sure to remove the card inside.  
   If you forgot, placing the miner back at the exact same position will restore the card.
[*] This mod does NOT modify any save content.  
   Excess miners will still exist after uninstalling, but all of them will point to the same original machine.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
[list]
[*] (not planning to fix for now):  If you can interact with multiple miners at once by slightly moving or turning in place, there is a chance you may open the wrong one.  When this happens, simply face the miner you want to open and move as close to it as possible.
